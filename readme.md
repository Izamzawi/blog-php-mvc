This website is a blog built with the PHP MVC concept. This blog supports some primary functions of a blog, e.g., user login, create a new post, and edit-delete an existing blog post. There is also a hidden admin register function, accessible via URL /register, not /login. 

This blog does not yet support the image uploading function. The front-end of this website is built with Bootstrap 4, while the text editor uses CKEditor.

You can check the functionalities of this blog via the available registered admin below:
'''
	'username' : 'adminbaru',
	'password' : '1234admin'
'''

Or you can register your credential by changing the URL /login with /register.

Thank you.
